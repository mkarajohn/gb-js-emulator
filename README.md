# GameBoy emulator in Javascript

Hopefully by making this project public I will be forced to complete it. ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬

Don't expect it to be done any time soon though, this is a first and a learning experience for me.

I know setting this up as a React project is an overkill, but I just wanted something with a working webpack configuration immediately.
